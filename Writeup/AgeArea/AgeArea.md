# Foundations of the Age-Area Hypothesis
### Matt Baker

---

# Background
- Disertation in the economic basis for indegenous institutions
- Big question: How culture, technology, and law co-evolve

---

# Recently
- Applications in economic growth
- Computational linguistics, computing power
- Incorporation of geographical data into analyses.

### Question: How did ethnic and geographic diversity that we observe today come about?

---
# Cultural similarities
- Closely related to genetic similarities
- Computational linguistics - treat aspects of language like a genetic code
- Build _Phylogenies_ of related cultures.
- Atkinson and Gray (2006) example: Indo-European Tree

## Questions: 
- Where did this tree originate? 
- How did the peoples of the tree come to be where they are?
- Which related cultures have been in close proximity, and for how long?

### These sorts of questions are about geography, cultural and lingustic drift, and time.

# The Age-Area Hypothesis (AAH)
- Sapir (1916) - the root of the tree is the geographical point of origin.
- Recursive application - migratory routes
- Used to resolve historical debates, but also could be important in new sorts of theorizing

---
# Why believe it?
- ### Occam's Razor?
- ### Minimum effort or \# of moves?

---
# A Phylogenetic Tree

Both are consistent with the linguistic evidence!

Better bullet point this shit
