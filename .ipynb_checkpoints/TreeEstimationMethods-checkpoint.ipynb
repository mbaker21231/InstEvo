    "# Estimating and Drawing Distributions over Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I am hoping to delineate how one might recover distributions over all resolutions of a tree, and all possible parameter values of a tree, given:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prior information on splits \n",
    "2. Dates of moribundity\n",
    "2. Locations and paths through locations\n",
    "3. Transitions among Dogolpolsky classes\n",
    "\n",
    "As it happens, we have a series of class methods - and in one case a stand-alone method which takes a parameterized tree as an argument - to calculate likelihood. While I have rolled this likelihood into `PyIeTools`, an example of it appears here, which shows how the likelihood is calculated over trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "There really is no unique way of doing this, so we will just lay out a method and see how it goes. In the sequel - where we implement estimation across a bunch of linguistic stocks in parallel, we will hopefully have some stylistic improvements to offer. \n",

    "Suppose we have decided on a resolution of our tree into a bifurcating tree so that all splits between groups are pairwise. Given this, we can calculate the likelihood of the tree using something like the following function (Once again after the usual job of importing all of our modules)\n",

    "In the above, `mlfun_ex()` is a replica of the function `mlfun()` which appears in the `PyIETools` module. What it does is takes parameters $x$, along with a parameterized Tree `Obj`, assigns the parameters to the Tree, unpacks them so that branch, word, moribundity, and prior parameters match up, and then progressively calculates the likelihood of the linguistic splits implied by the tree given our prior information, the likelihood of observing the current distribution of Dogopolsky classes across words given the transition-rate parameters and data, the likelihood of moribundity dates given prior information, and then the likelihood of migration emanating from the most likely point in the model. \n",
