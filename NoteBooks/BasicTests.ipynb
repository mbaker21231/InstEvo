    "# Working with Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on, we can now lay out a group of tools for wrestling with Trees in the ways in which we want to. As alluded to above, our view is that a tree is a sort of nested panel data structure. This data structure is a matrix, with the last column containing a set of unique identifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do it this way? Well, mainly because of my extensive experience with functions like `panelsetup()` and `panelsubmatrix()` in **Stata\\Mata**. Accordingly, I have made a few utility functions that do roughly the same as these: `ps()` and `psm()`, and also some other utility functions like `J()` for creating blank arrays, and `rows()` and `cols()` for getting rows and columns of matrices. As it happens, my programming has drifted away from these as I have gotten more used to Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We next need a few functions that replicate the functioning of `panelsubmatrix()` and `panelsetup()` in `Stata` and `Mata`. This will make things a bit easier to work with in terms of our tree. We will shorten the names a little bit, but otherwise work with the ideas as in `Stata`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resolved Trees \n",
    "\n",
    "These utilities form the basis for my first substantive function, `resolvedTree`. What it does is randomly resolves our set of nested panels into a strictly bifurcating set of panels (i.e., each panel subsequently splits into two panels). \n",
    "\n",
    "Why have such a function? Why not use a standard tree-puzzling algorithm? Well, for one very big reason: we do not want to randomly puzzle existing trees, but instead build _around_ existing trees. That is, I don't want my algorithms wasting time lumping Greek with Danish and splitting German out. I know German and Danish should be lumped together and Greek should be split out. \n",
    "\n",
    "One weakness of this algorithm is that it cannot split a group of 4 into two groups of two, but instead always splits a group of 4 into a group of one and a group of three. This is a practical programming difficulty, not a conceptual one, and one that I have to fix!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, let's begin by reading in our data from our pickled files, reading in our master data, our data on bifurcations, and our data on overall depths (and importing necessary packages):\n"

    "To describe how we can get different branch lengths from our tree, in a way that provides us information on history and time (which, remember, is the ultimate objective!), we deal with branches in the following fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that a full tree is of length one, and each branch is a fraction of this length. We therefore use a sort of nested logit approach to get a tree that is of normalized length. \n",

    "and so on. Of course, the last branch is simply what is left over when we get to the last column. Note that we do not need as many parameters as branches with this setup. Typically, there are $n-1$ internal branches of the tree which need a parameter. With this in mind, we can take a tree, and some internal branch parameters, and pass it to a method I've created called `timeFractions()`. This functino can also take information on whether or not a branch has gone moribund, and fill in this information using what I've been calling the `DM` matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `DM` matrix has a first column consisting of zeros and ones: zeros occur in the position of moribund languages. The second column contains parameters if the language is moribund. This parameter controls how much the final branch of the tree is shortened relative to the length of the whole tree (right now, normalized at one).\n",
